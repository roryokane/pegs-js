# Pegs

The game Pegs for the TI-83+ graphing calculator, ported to the browser.

[The original Pegs](http://www.detachedsolutions.com/puzzpack/pegs.php) was part of PuzzPack by Detached Solutions, and its main developer was Fred Coughlin. This port is by Rory O’Kane.

I already wrote a complete port of pegs to Adobe Flash in 2006, but never published it. Now I’m porting that port to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I already have all image assets the game needs (which I reproduced by hand, pixel-by-pixel), and ActionScript 2 code that reproduces all behavior of the original game. However, the old code needs refactoring – it uses too many comments and not enough constants and functions.
