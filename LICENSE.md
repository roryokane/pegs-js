I’m not sure of the licensing status of this program. I want to release it under the MIT License, but I don’t know the licensing status of the original PuzzPack game that contained Pegs.

What this port copies from PuzzPack:

- all graphics (hand-recreated)
- all level layouts (hand-recreated)
- the game design (which is not copyrightable)
